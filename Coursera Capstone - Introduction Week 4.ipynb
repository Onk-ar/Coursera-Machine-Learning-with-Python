    "\n",
    "It is no secret that Philippine food is very diverse with a lot of inspiration from a lot of different cultures which mingled either because of trade, migration, or colonization. Because of this, there are a lot of different kinds of restaurants littered around the city. \n",

    "\n",
    "Location finding is the most important step in starting a new restaurant. Ideally, it should be close to fresh markets selling fresh produce, fish and other necessary ingredients. Various other factors like proximity to malls, condominiums and business centers would also be accounted for as these would draw in more customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Target Audience\n",
